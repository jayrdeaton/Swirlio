// A thin wrapper (rather than importing LoadSkiaWeb directly at the call site) purely so this file's
// `.web.ts` counterpart, loadSkiaWeb.ts, gives native an identically-shaped async no-op — Metro's
// own platform-extension resolution then picks whichever one actually matches, with zero runtime
// branching and no risk of canvaskit-wasm's own web-only code ending up in the native bundle at all.
